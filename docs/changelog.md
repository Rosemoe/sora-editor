- More diagnostic indicator styles (`DiagnosticIndicatorStyle`)
- Approriate default size for diagnostic indicator lines

### Breaking changes

- `Span#problemFlags`, `MappedSpans#markProblemRegion` and `MappedSpans.Builder#markProblemRegion`
  are removed. Instead, you are expected to replace them with Diagnostic APIs
- In order to catch up with the updates from tm4e in time, some packages in language-textmate are
  moved to its original package in tm4e project.

### Migration Guide

> Mainly, your work will be miragting your problem marking logic to the new diagnostic API.
> Now, the diagnostics are sent by calling `StyleReceiver#setDiagnostics(DiagnosticContainer)`. You
> are expected to add
> your `DiagnosticRegion` objects to the `DiagnosticContainer`. The container will maintain the
> positions of those added
> regions. And also, `DiagnosticRegion` is described by the start index and end index of the
> diagnostic item, but not by (
> line, column) pairs. So you need to compute the index by shadowed Content.
> Note that it is - -not - - recommended to add new regions to a container that is already being
> used
> by editor though the
> class is thread-safe.
> See package `io.github.rosemoe.sora.lang.diagnostic`.

> package `io.github.rosemoe.langs.textmate.core`
> and `io.github.rosemoe.langs.textmate.languageconfiguration` are moved
> to `org.eclipse.tm4e.core` and `org.eclipse.tm4e.languageconfiguration`

### More information

- Now editor will show diagnostics with zero length. The editor will show the indicator with a width
  of the character 'a'.

### Note

- Maven artifact language-textmate 0.12.0 is broken. Use 0.12.0-1 instead.

### Bug fix

### Breaking changes

Almost everything has changed. lol...
But, some IMPORTANT Tips:

- Migrate your legacy addIfNeeded() invocations directly with a colorId to a checked one generated
  by `TextStyle#makeStyle(...)` to specify your styles and some other attributes (such as no
  completion). Unless you are confident that your values are valid (for fear that the bit count for
  foregroundColorId can be decreased in future releases. currently is 20 bits, far from we needed).
- Legacy analysis can be quickly migrated by using `SimpleAnalyzeManager`
- Spans are not always stored by an internal `List<List<Span>>`. Use Reader and Modifier APIs to get
  access to its content, unless you are sure about the instance's implementation.
- It's recommended that you use only one `Spans.Reader` and one `Spans.Modifier` at the same time.
- New completion system provides nothing but the exact position to complete in text. How to do the
  completion is up to you.
- The `SimpleCompletionItem` can not take the place of the old `CompletionItem`
- Shared data between auto-completion and analysis thread is not maintained by editor. You have to
  manage that by yourself
- CodeEditor adds a new method `release()` to stop completion threads and the analysis. It's
  recommended to invoke this method when the editor is no longer used(such as being removed from
  view forever or when activity ends).
- Avoid use CodeEditor's protected `drawXxx()` methods, they are likely to be changed. Also, methods
  or fields marked by annotation `@UnsupportedUserUsage` should not be used. Classes related to
  drawing should not be used (`HwAccerelatedRenderer` and `GraphicTextRow`).
- EditorPopupWindow provides some useful actions to create your own window in editor with good
  support
- NavigationItem is removed. It should be implemented by your `Language`
- `BlockLine` is renamed to `CodeBlock`
- Fields in `DirectAccessProps` can be directly modified. They are not required by editor at the
  time they are set. Modification takes effect the next time the actual value is accessed by editor.
