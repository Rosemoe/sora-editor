# Key binding

When working with a physical keyboard, you can use key bindings for performing various text actions.
The editor provides support for some key bindings by default. However, you can subscribe to
`KeyBindingEvent` and add your own key bindings. You can even override the default key bindings and
perform actions of your own.

The currently supported key bindings are mostly similar to Android Studio/Intellij IDEA.
See [the supported key](/es/customization/default-keybindings).
