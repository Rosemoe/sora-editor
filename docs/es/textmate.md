# textmate

!> **Work In Progress**

language-textmate module is a module that performs syntax highlighting and other functions
dynamically. To use it, you need to introduce several other textmate-* modules.

Our goal is to achieve the effect of VSCode. However, for many reasons, this may be difficult to
achieve in the short term.

- Eclipse also uses Textmate, and you can also get files from its related repositoryã€‚
- Textmate is also used in [vscode](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/tree/main/extensions), but
  its version is ahead of the version used in this module. You can get the configuration file from
  its source code, but not all of them can be used normally
