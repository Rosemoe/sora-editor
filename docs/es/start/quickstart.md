# Quickstart

It is recommended to use BOM for version management. You just need to specify the BOM version to
manage all module versions.

Add to your app's dependencies:

```
dependencies {
    implementation(platform("io.github.Rosemoe.sora-editor:bom:<versionName>"))
    implementation("io.github.Rosemoe.sora-editor:<moduleName>")
}
```

Available modules:

- editor   
  Widget library containing all basic things of the framework
- editor-lsp   
  A convenient library for creating languages by using Language Server Protocol (aka LSP)
- language-java   
  A simple implementation for Java highlighting and identifier auto-completion
- language-textmate   
  An advanced highlighter for the editor. You can find textmate language bundles and themes and load
  them by using this module. The internal implementation of textmate is
  from [tm4e](https://github.com/eclipse/tm4e)ã€‚
- language-treesitter   
  Offer [tree-sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/)support for editor. This can be
  used to parse the code to an AST fast and incrementally, which is helpful for accurate
  highlighting and providing completions. Note that this module only provides incremental paring and
  highlighting. Thanks to Java
  bindings [android-tree-sitter](https://github.com/AndroidIDEOfficial/android-tree-sitter/)

## Using Snapshot Versions

Snapshot releases are automatically generated on repository push. You may combine current released
version name and short commit hash to make a snapshot version name. For example, if the latest
released version name is `0.21.1` and short commit hash is `97c4963`, you may use version name
`0.21.1-97c4963-SNAPSHOT` to import the snapshot version to your project.

# Initializing the Project

Add CodeEditor in your layout file:

```
<io.github.rosemoe.sora.widget.CodeEditor
    android:id="@+id/editor"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="match_parent" />
```

This completes a basic editor.
