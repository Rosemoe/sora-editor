## Key bindings

When working with a physical keyboard, you can use key bindings for performing various text
actions.
The editor provides support for some key bindings by default.
However, you can subscribe
to [`KeyBindingEvent`](https://github.com/Rosemoe/sora-editor/blob/main/editor/src/main/java/io/github/rosemoe/sora/event/KeyBindingEvent.java)
and add your own key bindings. You can even override the default key bindings and perform actions of
your own.

The currently supported key bindings are mostly similar to Android Studio/Intellij IDEA.
See the [supported key bindings](./keybindings.md).

## Get started

Add to your app's dependencies:

```Gradle
dependencies {
    implementation(platform("io.github.Rosemoe.sora-editor:bom:<versionName>"))
    implementation("io.github.Rosemoe.sora-editor:<moduleName>")
}
```

Available modules:

- editor   
  Widget library containing all basic things of the framework
- editor-lsp   
  A convenient library for creating languages by using Language Server Protocol (aka LSP)
- language-java   
  A simple implementation for Java highlighting and identifier auto-completion
- language-textmate   
  An advanced highlighter for the editor. You can find textmate language bundles and themes and load
  them by using this
  module. The internal implementation of textmate is from [tm4e](https://github.com/eclipse/tm4e).
- language-treesitter   
  Offer [tree-sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/) support for editor. This can be
  used to
  parse the code to an AST fast and incrementally, which is helpful for accurate highlighting and
  providing completions.
  Note that this module only provides incremental paring and highlighting. Thanks to Java
  bindings [android-tree-sitter](https://github.com/AndroidIDEOfficial/android-tree-sitter/)
